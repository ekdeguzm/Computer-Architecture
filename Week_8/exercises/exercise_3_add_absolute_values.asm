# Exercise 3 - Add Absolute Values (MPA.E3)

# (2 pts) Write a program that makes an array of integers called array in the .data section.
# It should print the sum of the absolute values of the numbers in that array. 
# (Recall that the absolute value of a number is just the number, 
# if the number is positive, or the positive version of the number, if the number is negative.)
# You should also have a variable called array_size in the .data section which is set to the number of 
# elements in your array.

# If the array contained 2, -3, 4, and -5, for example, your program should print 14. (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14.)
